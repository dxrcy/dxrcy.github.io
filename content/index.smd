I like programming and language.
I speak English, Esperanto, and Rust,
and am interested in low-level and systems programming, and web development.

# [Projects]($section.id('projects'))

## βcalc -- Lambda Calculus Evaluator

_Language: Zig_

Command-line tool which parses, evaluates, and unifies lambda calculus
expressions, focusing on speed and minimal allocation.

## chesst -- Terminal Chess Game

_Language: Zig_

Two-player chess game built without any libraries, rendered in the terminal.

## EveryGarf -- Download every _Garfield_ comic

_Language: Rust_

A command-line tool which scrapes _GoComics.com_ to download every _Garfield_
comic concurrently.

## LASIM -- LC-3 Assembler & Simulator

_Language: C++_

An implementation of both an assembler and simulator for the _Little Computer 3_
(_LC-3_) assembly language.

## Ibex -- Static site generation framework

_Language: Rust_

Write HTML-style templates which compile to static HTML files.
Perfect for sites without dynamic content, that are only changed occasionally.

### Other Projects

- This webpage
- Sorting algorithm visualiser (_Rust_)
- Command-line XML syntax highlighter (_C_)

# [Contributions]($section.id('contributions'))

## Git ✨

_Language: C_

Fixed a bug relating to integer underflow when using a commit timestamp close to
Unix Epoch with a positive timezone offset. GitHub shows the PR as
closed/unmerged, because the Git repo on GitHub is just a mirror.

## Lace -- LC-3 assembly toolchain

_Language: Rust_

Implemented an interactive debugger interface, along with many other minor features and fixes.

### Other Contributions

- MCPP -- Minecraft interface library (_C++_)
- Ferdium -- Social media manager (_Typescript_, _React_, _Electron_)
- Nvim-Tree -- File explorer for NeoVim (_Lua_)
- Yazi -- Terminal file explorer (_Rust_)
- SpotDL -- Spotify download tool (_Python_)
- Neothesia -- MIDI visualiser (_Rust_)

# [Programming Experience]($section.id('programming-experience'))

## Rust

Rust provides a fantastic type system and ecosystem, with its safety guarantees
being just another benefit.

- Static site generation frameworks
- Image processing
- Graphics rendering (ggez)
- Procedural macros and metaprogramming

## Zig

Zig is hands-down my favourite language to work with, due to its simplicity,
low-level capabilities, and compile-time evaluation.

- Terminal user interfaces
- Dynamically loaded libaries
- Custom language parsers
- Algorithm implementations

## C++ and C

C++ is great (yes, I said it).

- Compiler and interpreter implementations
- Concurrent programming
- Custom memory allocation
- Low-level programming on POSIX systems

## Javascript/Typescript

A necessary skill for front-end web development.

- Client-side vanilla Javascript in HTML
- React single-page applications
- Server-side programming with Node.JS
- Electron applications

## Miscellaneous

- Languages: Python, Bash, Lua, Java, Haskell
- Tools: coreutils, FFmpeg, Autohotkey

# [/etc/]($section.id('etc'))

## My Workflow

- EndevourOS
- Hyprland
- Neovim
- Tmux

## Some of my favourite standards/protocols

- ISO-8601
- Unicode and UTF-8
- POSIX
