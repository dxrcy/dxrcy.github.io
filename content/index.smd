I like programming and language.
I speak English, Esperanto, and Rust,
and am interested in low-level and systems programming, and web development.

# [Contributions]($section.id('contributions'))

## Git ✨

_Language: C_

Fixed a bug relating to integer underflow when using a commit timestamp close to
Unix Epoch with a positive timezone offset. GitHub shows the PR as
closed/unmerged, because the Git repo on GitHub is just a mirror.

- [View pull request](https://github.com/git/git/pull/1726) (merged)

## Lace -- LC-3 assembly toolchain

_Language: Rust_

Implemented an interactive debugger interface, along with many other minor features and fixes.

# [Programming Experience]($section.id('programming-experience'))

## Rust

Rust provides a fantastic type system and ecosystem, with its safety guarantees
being just another benefit.

- Static site generation frameworks
- Image processing
- Graphics rendering (ggez)
- Procedural macros and metaprogramming

## Zig

Zig is hands-down my favourite language to work with, due to its simplicity,
low-level capabilities, and compile-time evaluation.

- Terminal user interfaces
- Dynamically loaded libraries
- Custom language parsers
- Algorithm implementations

## C++ and C

C++ is great (yes, I said it).

- Compiler and interpreter implementations
- Concurrent programming
- Custom memory allocation
- Low-level programming on POSIX systems

## JavaScript/TypeScript

A necessary skill for front-end web development.

- Client-side vanilla JavaScript in HTML
- React single-page applications
- Server-side programming with Node.js
- Electron applications

## Miscellaneous

- Languages: Python, Bash, Lua, Java, Haskell
- Tools: coreutils, FFmpeg, AutoHotKey

# [/etc/]($section.id('etc'))

## My Workflow

EndeavourOS + Hyprland + Neovim + tmux.
